Web App Hacking Technologies
Web application hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web technologies to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt application functionality. The following web technologies are commonly targeted by hackers:

HTTP and HTTPS: Understanding how HTTP and HTTPS requests are handled by web servers is crucial for web application hacking. Familiarity with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and query parameters is essential.
HTML and JavaScript: Knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is necessary for understanding client-side vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
CSS: CSS injection attacks can be used to manipulate web page layout and inject malicious code.
AJAX and JSON: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) enable dynamic web content and are vulnerable to attacks like JSON injection and AJAX-based XSS.
Web Frameworks: Popular web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and Laravel have their own set of vulnerabilities and security considerations.
Database Technologies: Understanding database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB is important for identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Content Management Systems (CMS): CMS platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are frequently targeted due to their widespread use and known vulnerabilities.
Web Servers: Familiarity with web servers like Apache, Nginx, and IIS is necessary for identifying and exploiting server-side vulnerabilities.
APIs and Microservices: Modern web applications often rely on APIs and microservices, which introduce new attack surfaces and require specialized knowledge for secure development and testing.
Common Web Application Hacking Techniques

SQL Injection: Injecting malicious SQL code to extract or modify sensitive data.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting client-side code to steal user data or take control of user sessions.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Forcing users to perform unintended actions on behalf of an attacker.
File Upload Vulnerabilities: Exploiting vulnerabilities in file upload mechanisms to inject malicious code or steal sensitive data.
Authentication Bypass: Bypassing authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to web applications.
Session Hijacking: Stealing or manipulating user sessions to gain unauthorized access.
Input Validation and Sanitization: Exploiting weaknesses in input validation and sanitization mechanisms to inject malicious data.
Defense Mechanisms

Secure Coding Practices: Following secure coding guidelines and best practices for web application development.
Input Validation and Sanitization: Implementing robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent malicious data injection.
Authentication and Authorization: Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to web applications.
Regular Security Audits and Updates: Conducting regular security audits and updating web applications with the latest security patches and updates.
Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): Implementing WAFs to detect and prevent common web attacks.
Conclusion

Web application hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in web technologies to gain unauthorized access or disrupt application functionality. Understanding web technologies, common hacking techniques, and defense mechanisms is essential for securing web applications and preventing attacks.
